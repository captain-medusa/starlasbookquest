Octavia Butler is a name that stands tall in science fiction, known for her powerful and thought-provoking stories that explore race, identity, and survival in ways few others have. In 2010, she was posthumously awarded theÂ Eugene E. Myers Infinity Award, solidifying her lasting impact on the genre.

While I havenâ€™t read all of her works yet, Iâ€™ve dived deep into theÂ PatternmasterÂ seriesâ€”a gripping journey where I had to choose between reading the books in publication order or chronologically <mark>(I went with publication!)</mark>. For this list, Iâ€™ve sorted all her books in the order they were originally published, along with some of my favorite cover art.

This isnâ€™t her full bibliography, just a selection of 13 covers I like ðŸ™‚ 

Did you know thereâ€™s 13 numbers in a ISBN ? There used to be 10 but now itâ€™s 13.
I love the colors in those covers, it inspired me to use them on my header pic!

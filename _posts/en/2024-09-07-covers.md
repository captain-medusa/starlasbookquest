Hey fellow spacefarers! 🚀 I’ve been having some fun with AI creating some alternative cover art for a few classics. What do you think of the results ? Can you guess which books I’ve chosen ? 


<div class="grid grid-2up grid-2-to-4up">
        <div>
          <img src="{{'/assets/images/covers/doomsday-book.jpeg'| absolute_url}}" alt="">
          <figcaption></figcaption>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="{{'/assets/images/covers/dragonflight.png'| absolute_url}}" alt="">
          <figcaption></figcaption>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="{{'/assets/images/covers/hunger-games.jpeg'| absolute_url}}" alt="">
          <figcaption></figcaption>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img src="{{'/assets/images/covers/downbelow-station.jpeg'| absolute_url}}" alt="">
          <figcaption></figcaption>
        </div>       
</div>
I've also asked one-liners for each of those books but I forgot what went with what, silly me 😝!<br>

- "A gripping, dystopian thrill ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Unputdownable!”- <mark>nery</mark>
- "A soaring blend of science fiction and fantasy that captures the imagination from the first page.” -<mark>dero</mark>
- "A masterful blend of history, science fiction, and heart-wrenching human drama. Unforgettable.”-<mark>ands</mark>
- "A complex, compelling narrative of power, survival, and humanity’s place among the stars.”-<mark>skil</mark>

Can you help me match the right covers with the right reviews ? 🙈 <br>
Once you're done, you should really look at my post on maps ! It may lead you to the place you’re looking for 😉 !

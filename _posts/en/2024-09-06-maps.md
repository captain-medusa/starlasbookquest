Greetings, fellow explorers of the unknown! 🌍
Today I’m taking you on a journey through one of the most beautiful, intricate, and downright magical map from the worlds of sci-fi and fantasy : Earthsea by **Ursula K. Le Guin.**

This map transported me through Ged’s journeys, from Gont to the island of Roke to perfect his education, and Tenar’s adventures on the mysterious island of Atuan. I imagined living in this fascinating world, perhaps on a small island near Selidor, where dragons 🐉 reign supreme, or maybe on <mark>Lorbanery</mark> 🏝️, running a silk trade. A dream, right?

Hey there, cosmic detectives! 🔍 Today, I’m diving into the brilliant world of *Far Sector*, the thrilling comic book series by N.K. Jemisin. You may know Jemisin for her groundbreaking novels like *The Broken Earth Trilogy*, or the *Great Cities Series* with the *City we Became* and *the world we make* but did you know she also wrote a *Green Lantern* comic? That’s right! *Far Sector* follows Jo Mullein, a Green Lantern tasked with keeping peace in the City Enduring—a metropolis on the edge of the universe where emotions have been suppressed for centuries.

At the beginning of each issue, Jemisin included a thought-provoking quote, aren’t they great ?

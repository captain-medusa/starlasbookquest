I recently stumbled across something that hit me right in the childhood nostalgia: a coloring book!

I’ve decided to turn my header pic into a color-by-code image—so not only can you see it, but you can color it too! 
What do you think? Would you have the patience to finish a color-coded painting today, or would you get as distracted as I might? Let me know in the comments!

<div class="grid">
        <div>
          <img src="{{ 'assets/images/bookcase-bw.svg' | absolute_url }}" alt="black and white header bookshelf">
          <figcaption></figcaption>
        </div>
